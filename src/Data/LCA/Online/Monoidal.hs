--
-- Provides online calculation of the the lowest common ancestor in /O(log h)/
-- by compressing the spine of the paths using a skew-binary random access
-- list.
--
-- This library implements the technique described in my talk
--
-- <http://www.slideshare.net/ekmett/skewbinary-online-lowest-common-ancestor-search>
--
-- to improve the known asymptotic bounds on both online lowest common ancestor search
--
-- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor>
--
-- and the online level ancestor problem:
--
-- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_ancestor_problem>
--
-- Algorithms used here assume that the key values chosen for @k@ are
-- globally unique.
--
-- This version provides access to a monoidal \"summary\" of the
-- elided path for many operations.
